# Real-Time-Triangulated-Market-Intelligence-System-Pipeline
A serverless financial dashboard that monitors stock/ETF watchlists, analyzes 50/200-day moving averages, scrapes user-defined news sources for AI-driven sentiment analysis, and predicts currency fluctuations using Python and AWS.

## Overview

The **Real-Time Triangulated Market Intelligence System** is a cloud-native, serverless platform designed to help investors move beyond raw market data and fragmented insights. Instead of acting as a passive stock tracker, the system **correlates multiple independent signals** to generate explainable **Buy / Sell / Hold** recommendations in near real time.

The core principle behind the system is **triangulation**: validating market decisions by combining **technical price behavior**, **fundamental financial health**, and **news & macro sentiment**. This multi-dimensional approach reduces noise and improves confidence compared to single-indicator strategies.

## Problem Statement

Modern investors face:

* Information overload from charts, news, and metrics spread across platforms
* Conflicting signals between technical indicators and fundamentals
* Manual effort to track earnings, sentiment, and macro risks

Most stock websites **display data** but leave the cognitive burden of interpretation to the user. This project focuses on **automated signal correlation and decision logic**, not just visualization.

---

## Key Capabilities

### 1. User-Driven Asset Tracking

* Users can dynamically add or remove **stocks**.
* Each ticker is independently processed through the intelligence pipeline
* The system maintains a persistent state per asset

---

### 2. Technical Market Intelligence

For each tracked ticker, the system computes:

* Current market price
* 6-month historical price chart
* 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA)
* All-Time High (ATH) and All-Time Low (ATL)
* 52-week High and 52-week Low

These indicators establish **trend direction, momentum, and risk boundaries**.

---

### 3. News & Sentiment Intelligence

* Financial news is treated as a **continuous data signal**
* Headlines are periodically scraped from system-managed sources
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) classifies sentiment as:

  * Positive
  * Negative
  * Neutral

This layer captures **market psychology and narrative shifts** that are often missed by price-only analysis.

---

### 4. Fundamental & Earnings Analysis

To validate technical signals, the system tracks:

* 30-day rolling earnings calendar
* Post-earnings strength and weakness analysis
* Automated EPS classification:

  * Exceeded
  * Met
  * Missed
* Key financial metrics:

  * EPS
  * P/E Ratio
  * Total Debt
  * Free Cash Flow

---

## Triangulated Decision Logic

Recommendations are generated by correlating **three independent dimensions**:

* **Technical**: Price position relative to long-term trends
* **Fundamental**: Earnings performance and financial stability
* **Sentiment & Macro**: News tone and external risk indicators

### Simplified Decision Rules

* **BUY**
  Price > 200-day SMA
  AND sentiment is positive
  AND EPS exceeded expectations

* **SELL**
  Price < 200-day SMA
  OR sentiment is negative

* **HOLD**
  Mixed or neutral signals with market consolidation

This structure helps reduce **false positives** common in single-signal systems.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Design

The system follows a **serverless, event-driven architecture** on AWS with zero idle infrastructure.

#### Frontend

* Static web interface hosted on **Amazon S3**
* Accepts ticker input
* Displays charts, metrics, sentiment, earnings, and recommendations

#### API Layer

* **Amazon API Gateway**
* Secure REST endpoints for frontend communication

#### Backend Compute (AWS Lambda)

* **user-ticker-handler**

  * Handles add, get, and delete operations for tracked assets
* **user_price_fetcher**

  * Fetches market data
  * Computes technical indicators
  * Evaluates fundamentals
  * Generates Buy / Sell / Hold signals
* **news_scraping_and_sentiment**

  * Scrapes financial news
  * Performs NLP-based sentiment classification

#### Data Layer

* **Amazon DynamoDB**

  * Acts as the system’s source of truth
  * Stores tickers, computed metrics, sentiment scores, and decisions

#### Automation

* **Amazon EventBridge**

  * Schedules recurring sentiment refresh
  * Monitors upcoming earnings within a rolling 30-day window

---

## Why This Project Is Different

Unlike traditional stock market websites, this system:

* **Correlates signals instead of displaying them in isolation**
* Automates interpretation through decision logic
* Treats news and earnings as **data streams**, not static information
* Demonstrates real-world **serverless data engineering patterns**
* Focuses on explainability, not black-box predictions

This makes the project particularly relevant for **Data Engineer, Cloud Engineer, and Backend roles**, where system design and data orchestration matter more than UI alone.

---

## Technology Stack

* **Compute**: AWS Lambda (Python)
* **API**: Amazon API Gateway
* **Database**: Amazon DynamoDB
* **NLP**: Amazon Comprehend
* **Automation**: Amazon EventBridge
* **Frontend Hosting**: Amazon S3

---

## Future Enhancements

* User-configurable alert thresholds for price and trend changes
* SNS-based notifications for high-impact market events
* Custom news source configuration per ticker
* Historical data lake in S3 for backtesting and analytics
* LLM-based summarization of earnings reports and filings

---

## Outcome

This project demonstrates how **serverless data engineering and multi-factor signal correlation** can bridge the gap between raw market data and actionable intelligence, delivering professional-grade insights with minimal infrastructure overhead.
